# Active Plan — Session Coordination

> **Purpose**: Short-term shared whiteboard for agent coordination during active sessions.
> For project lifecycle planning, see `.planning/` (PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md).
> This file handles ephemeral session state — which agents are active, what's blocked, immediate handoffs.
